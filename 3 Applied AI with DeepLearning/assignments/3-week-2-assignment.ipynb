Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will past the accuracy of your model to the Coursera grader.\n\nThis notebook is tested in IBM Watson Studio under python 3.6\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by installing and importing everything we need for this exercise:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install --upgrade keras-applications keras-preprocessing setuptools tensorflow==1.14.0 keras==2.2.5", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import tensorflow\nif not tensorflow.__version__ == '1.14.0':\n    print(tensorflow.__version__)\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to TensorFlow 1.14.0, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')\n\nimport keras\nif not keras.__version__ == '2.2.5':\n    print(keras.__version__)\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to Keras 2.2.5, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "IMPORTANT! => Please restart the kernel by clicking on \"Kernel\"->\"Restart and Clear Outout\" and wait until all output disapears. Then your changes are beeing picked up\n\nAs you can see, we use Keras' Sequential model with only two types of layers: Dense and Dropout. We also specify a random seed to make our results reproducible. Next, we load the Reuters data set:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import numpy as np\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Dropout\nfrom keras.utils import to_categorical\nseed = 1337\nnp.random.seed(seed)\nfrom keras.datasets import reuters\n\nmax_words = 1000\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = reuters.load_data(num_words=max_words,\n                                                         test_split=0.2,\n                                                         seed=seed)\nnum_classes = np.max(y_train) + 1  # 46 topics", "execution_count": 5, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Note that we cap the maximum number of words in a news item to 1000 by specifying the *num_words* key word. Also, 20% of the data will be test data and we ensure reproducibility by setting our random seed.\n\nOur training features are still simply sequences of indexes and we need to further preprocess them, so that we can plug them into a *Dense* layer. For this we use a *Tokenizer* from Keras' text preprocessing module. This tokenizer will take an index sequence and map it to a vector of length *max_words=1000*. Each of the 1000 vector positions corresponds to one of the words in our newswire corpus. The output of the tokenizer has a 1 at the i-th position of the vector, if the word corresponding to i is in the description of the newswire, and 0 otherwise. Even if this word appears multiple times, we still just put a 1 into our vector, i.e. our tokenizer is binary.
