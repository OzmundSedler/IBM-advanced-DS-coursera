Therefore we want you to understand how to migrate from a numpy program to a SystemML DML program. Don't worry. We will give you a lot of hints. Finally, you won't need this knowledge anyways if you are sticking to Keras only, but once you go beyond that point you'll be happy to see what's going on behind the scenes. Please make sure you run this notebook from an Apache Spark 2.3 notebook.\n\nSo the first thing we need to ensure is that we are on the latest version of SystemML, which is 1.2.0:\n\nThe steps are:\n- pip install\n- link the jars to the correct location\n- restart the kernel\n- start execution at the cell with the version - check"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install systemml", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Now we need to create two sym links that the newest version is picket up - this is a workaround and will be removed soon"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!ln -s -f ~/user-libs/python3.6/systemml/systemml-java/systemml-1.2.0-extra.jar ~/user-libs/spark2/systemml-1.2.0-extra.jar\n!ln -s -f ~/user-libs/python3.6/systemml/systemml-java/systemml-1.2.0.jar ~/user-libs/spark2/systemml-1.2.0.jar", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Now please restart the kernel and make sure the version is correct"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from systemml import MLContext\nml = MLContext(spark)\nprint(ml.version())\n    \nif not ml.version() == '1.2.0':\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to SystemML 1.2.0, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')", "execution_count": 1, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Waiting for a Spark session to start...\nSpark Initialization Done!
